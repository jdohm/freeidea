# OpenIdea

[OpenIdea](https://www.openidea.io/) is an open idea exchange platform based on [openglobus](https://github.com/openglobus/openglobus). 

This project is in an early state and can change at any time.

You can visit our hosted website at [OpenIdea.IO](https://www.openidea.io/). Please keep in mind that we are in early alpha and saved data could be lost or deleted at any point in time.

## Peeds words 
This (OpenIdea.io) is a place to bring your Ideas to live. You can post Ideas and find people to work together on Ideas. I think many humans have really good Ideas but can not bring them to live because they don't have the needed skills to do this. This is absolutly normal because we as mankind have crated so much knowledge that people alone can not handle all diciplines to bring the Idea to live alone. Here they can connect to other people which like to help them bringing the Idea they had to live. 

## Documentation

Check out the OpenGlobus basis [hosted examples](http://www.openglobus.org/examples.html), or the [API documentation](http://www.openglobus.org/api/). Our project is build on top of this.

## Get Started to help this project come to live
There are lots of ways to help. It could be spreading the word, leaving something nice to say, financial support, reporting problems you encounter while surfing [OpenIdea](https://www.openidea.io/) or even working on the code or graphics. 

Also consider contributing to [openglobus](https://github.com/openglobus/openglobus) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) without them this project would't be possible and we profit from every good contribution over there as well.
